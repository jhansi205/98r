        <dt>mailto:mail id</dt>
        <dd>href="mailto:jhansi1239@sasi.ac.in"</dd>

        <dd>rowspan attribute is used within a &lt td &gt (table cell) tag to specify how many rows a cell should span. This attribute allows you to merge multiple rows into a single cell.</dd>
        <dt> layout semantic elements</dt>
        <dd>Semantic elements in HTML are tags that carry meaning about the structure and content of a web page. They provide information about the role of the enclosed content, making the HTML document more understandable for both browsers and developers.ex:nav,section,aside,header,footer,article </dd>
        <dt>nav:</dt>
        <dd>open links in the navbar</dd>
        <dt>refering notes in the book</dt>
        <dt>aside:</dt>
        <dd>it means left side or right side show the content using aside element</dd>
        <dt>footer</dt>
        <dd>bottom of the webpage</dd>
        <dt>id</dt>
        <dd>particular link using identity(id)</dd>
        <dt>DIV:div is not describe  about the content</dt>
        <dd>div is a container which contains any element and any content but it looks like container.div is not any defining.div is block line element because it occupies whole space</dd>
        <dt>SPAN</dt>
        <dd>span is also container it works like div .but the difference is span is inline element</dd>
        <dt>Class</dt>
        <dd>A class selector is denoted by a dot (.) followed by the class name. It allows you to select and style multiple elements that share the same class.</dd>
        <dt>ID</dt>
        <dd>An id selector is denoted by a hash (#) followed by the id name. It is used to select and style a unique element on the page because HTML elements should have unique ids.</dd>
        <dt>NOTE:</dt>
        <dd>while multiple elements can share the same class, an id must be unique within the HTML document. Classes are commonly used for styling reusable components or groups of elements, while ids are typically used to uniquely identify and style a specific element.</dd>
        <dt>form</dt>
        <dd>user is provided the input is called form</dd>
        <dt>placeholder</dt>
        <dd>it is used for the name should be in the box</dd>
        <dt>Radio</dt>
        <dd>choose only one option same name for the input elements</dd>
        <dt>name :</dt>
        <dd>name must should use in form it plays a key role</dd>
        <dt>Button</dt>

        <dt>Required</dt>
        <dd>it si using for must and should fill the box in the form</dd>
        <dt>Value</dt>
        <dd>it is used for input element it shows the defalut(fill intheform incode)value</dd>
        <dt> Form two methods</dt>
        <dt>1.get method: it will appended in the top of the url</dt>
        <dt>2.post method:All data is not sent in the url does not show any data it show page is not working show </dt>
        <dt>minlength</dt>
        <dd>length of the characters</dd>
        <dt>min</dt>
        <dd>value of the number</dd>
        <dt>meta tag</dt>
        <dd>Meta tags in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) are elements that provide metadata about a document. They are included in the head section of an HTML document and do not produce any visible content on the web page. Instead, meta tags convey information to browsers, search engines, and other web services about the document. Here are some common meta tags and their purposes</dd>
        <dt>&ltmeta charset="UTF-8"&gt</dt>
        <dd>Specifies the character encoding for the HTML document. UTF-8 is widely used and supports a broad range of characters.</dd>
        <dt>&ltmeta name="description" content="Brief description of the page"&gt</dt>
        <dd>Provides a concise description of the web page. Search engines may use this information in search results.</dd>
        <dt>&ltmeta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3"&gt</dt>
        <dd>Specifies a comma-separated list of keywords related to the content of the page. This tag is less important for search engines today, as they primarily analyze content for relevance.</dd>
        <dt>&ltmeta name="author" content="Author Name"&gt</dt>
        <dd>Indicates the author of the web page.</dd>
        <dt>&lteta http-equiv="refresh" content="5;url=https://example.com"&gt</dt>
        <dd>The refresh meta tag is used to automatically refresh or redirect a web page after a specified number of seconds.This example refreshes the page after 5 seconds and redirects to "https://example.com."</dd>
